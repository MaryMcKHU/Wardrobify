## Design

## Shoes microservice

There will be two models -- one will be the Shoe model and the other will have to be a BinVO model, which
originates from the wardrobe/api/wardrobe-api/models.py where the Bin model was created. The BinVO model
will have all of the information that the Bin Model has, in addition to an href. 

## Hats microservice

Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe
microservice, here.
